    <h2>Alleyway maze...</h2>

    <img src="alley.png" alt="Alley" style="width:25%">
    
    <p> You had to run down the dark alleyway. The demons were fast 
        approaching. As you enter the alley darkness surrounds you. It takes a
        good minute for your eyes to adjust before you can properly see again.
        Still in fear of being chased you continue running down the alley for 
        another 5 minutes or so. The alley is long and relies on sunlight of 
        which it doesnt get much at all.<br><br> Finally the alley forks off and comes
        to a junction. But you don't know where either of the routes go... 
        Looking over your shoulder you see the demons catching up with you - 
        still with that same expression of anger and a desire 
        for blood. You have to pick a path - <strong>QUICKLY!</strong>
