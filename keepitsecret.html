    <p>You chose to keep this whole thing to yourself and not tell a single 
        soul. That night you stayed at your friends. It seemed safe, it 
        really did. You quietly had dinner with their family, watched a film
        and went to bed. It came to the early hours of the morning and you 
        still couldn't sleep. Every slight little noise filled you with fear.
        Your mind kept thinking of the demon looming over you in the shop, 
        ready to tear you apart with it's claws. Clenching your eyes shut you
        try hard to fall asleep. You feel a presence above you. Opening your 
        eyes reveals the same demon as before. You try to scream but with a 
        snap of its long gnarled fingers you cannot. You can only scream 
        internally and that you do. You glance over to your friend in the 
        other bed - totally unaware of what's happening here. If only you had
        told them. <br><br> With a painful swift movement of the demons claws
        it slits your throat. Blood gushes out and onto the bedsheets. It's 
        excruciatingly painful for you. The demon drops your lifeless corpse 
        and you are stuck watching from 3rd person. You watch your limp body 
        crumple in a heap on the floor. The demon glides over toward your 
        friend. They wake up and look over to see your body lying on the 
        ground, before they get a chance to let out a scream or act the demon
        has violently detached their head from their body. Their skin goes 
        pale and they too fall to the floor in a heap. You have no choice but
        to watch on helplessly.<br><br> The demon turns and looks at you 
        with its evil eyes. It disappears and you are left roaming for 
        eternity as a ghost. A ghost who got their friend killed.
