    <p>You made the wise decision of getting the out of there immediately. You
        barge past the demon and head out of the shop onto the street.  A few 
        passerbys glance at you but carry on walking. You start yelling at 
        everyone telling them abou the demon! You receive odd looks and stares
        , a woman covers her childs eyes and leads them across the road away 
        from you. Knowing that this terrifying demon is in the shop you make 
        it a priority to put as much distance between you and it as possible. 
        You begin sprinting as fast as you can. The pavements are busy and 
        folk aren't getting out of the way, you run onto the road. After a 
        relatively short sprint you realise that you will soon tire out and 
        the demon could catch up with you. <br><br>There is a taxi rank a few blocks 
        away and there is a bus stop nearby. Both options could help you 
        escape! Which do you choose?</p>
