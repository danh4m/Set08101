    <p>You chose to run to the taxi rank just a few blocks away. Arriving 
        dripping with sweat you see that there is only one taxi. Desperate to 
        escaper you get in and yell <strong>DRIVE</strong>. The taxi driver 
        zooms off and you feel a brief sense of relief. Sweat rolls down your 
        neck. You are safe... or so you thought. After a moment you look out 
        the back windows to see hordes of zombies, demons and ghouls wandering 
        the street. Oh no! There are dozens of people walking the street 
        seemingly not taking any notice of them... strange. <br> <br> Suddenly,
        the taxi swerves and you pay attention to the driver for the first 
        time. Their black hood covers their face and their hands on the wheel 
        are covered with black gloves. The rear view mirror appears to be 
        missing. Feeling your seatbelt tighten, the taxi flips and rolls 
        several times. You are hurt. The taxi driver turns their head, looks 
        at you and says "It's time". Finally you are able to see their face 
        with its skeletal features and soulless eyes. Death. <br><br>Death watches 
        you as everything fades into darkness, into nothingness.
