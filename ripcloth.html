    <p>You choose to vigourously rip the cloth out of the box. A powerful 
        energy launches you backwards crashing through the door of the shop.
        Crashing through the doors and skidding across the wooden planked 
        floor, you find yourself at the foot of a tall shelving unit. 'What 
        the fuck was that?' you think to yourself. The tall shelving unit next
        to you is wobbling, heavy-looking antiques balance precariously on 
        the edges. As you are about too get up you see it falling. A brass 
        clock that had been sitting on the top shelf undisturbed for years 
        was falling straight for your head. Time slows down and you squint at
        the clock almost making out the engraving underneath.<br><br> You try to get
        your arms up to catch the clock or block it from hitting your head 
        but its too late. Time resumes. The clock is picking up speed and 
        hurtling directly toward your skull. <strong>*CRACK*</strong>. 
        Everything goes black. That was the sound of the antique clock hitting
        your skull at pace.<br><br> You are dead.
