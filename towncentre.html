        You head to the town centre in the hope that it will be busy so you 
        won't get attacked. Right enough the town is busy and not just with 
        the living. Ghosts and demons glide around the streets aimlessly. 
        No one bats an eyelid seemingly. Out of the corner of your eye you see
        the same demon from the shop. It looks angry and lets out a terrible
        roar. Upon hearing this, other demons turn toward you with the same 
        angry expression.<br><br><strong>time to run</strong>... you sprint toward a 
        large shopping mall. To access the mall you must pass through a video
        game arcade. Upon reaching the entrance a man stops you and says "I 
        won't let you in unless you challenge one of my games".<br><br> You don't have
        enough time to explain everything to him and theres no way you could 
        squeeze past him. To the left you see a dark alleyway where you could 
        run to. What do you do?
