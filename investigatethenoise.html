    <h2>Investigate the noise...</h2>

    <p>You choose to investigate the noise, a wise choice. Trying to determine
        where it is coming from you walk around the dimly lit shop. The tall 
        shelves loom over you menacingly casting their long shadow. The noise
        stops for a second, you halt and hear the noise of the floorboards 
        creaking below you. The noise resumes and at this point it is quite 
        clear to you where it is coming from. You head toward the door where 
        the mysterious box was abandoned. As you open the door the little bell
        attached produces an out of tune ring. a small gust of wind blows in 
        as the door widens open slowly, you don't notice anything else on the
        pavement, no leaves or cracks in the pavement. You can only focus on
        the box. There is a strange aura about it and it seems as though now 
        that you have gone toward it you can do nothing but take it inside and
        see whats inside. You bend over to pick it up, wrap your fingers 
        around the edges and pull it from the ground. The box rushes up with 
        you as though it was empty. accidentally leaving the door ajar, you 
        head back inside the shop carrying the box with no effort at all and 
        place it on the shop counter. suddenly a powerful gust of wind slams 
        the wooden door shut behind you. you jump out of your skin, what a 
        fright that gave you. "It was just the wind" you tell yourself as you
        head to the other side of the counter for some scissors to cut the 
        tape wrapped around the cardboard box. With one swift movement of the 
        scissors the tape is cut and you are able to open the box. You move 
        the cardboard flaps to either side to reveal a purple velvet cloth 
        covering the contents of the box. You can hear blood pumping in your 
        head, you are very tense. You can rip the cloth off as quick as you 
        can or you can gently drag it off.
