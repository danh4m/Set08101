    <p>You thought it would be a good idea to fight this 6 foot 3 demon standing before you. Okay lets do this... <br> With all the strength you can muster you swing your fist toward the evil presence before you. As you make contact your hand disappears into a swirl of darnkess and goes straight through the demon. This seemed to have no impact whatsoever on the beast. It let out a soul piercing howl and advanced toward you. Its long arms reached toward you and grabbed you. Its claws curled around your arms at your side and lifted you up. You could feel blood leaving your body from where the claws were squeezing at either side of you. You tried to move. You were paralysed with fear. The evil being lifted you up effortlessly and opened its jaws all whilst still screeching that evil sound. The creature tore apart your scalp and skull almost instantly. You didn't stand a chance. At least you weren't able to feel the rest of the pain as the demon excruciatingly tore you apart piece by piece. Your corpse lay stiff on creaky floorboards of the antique shop you once worked in.</p>
