    <p>You think nothing of this noise - it could be the wind outside or an 
        old pipe somewhere. You go to turn the dusty old radio on behind the 
        till, holding your breath to prevent any inhalation of dust you reach 
        up and try to configure it to a radio station. You can't find any. 
        Each station plays out a horribly irritating static noise. You give up
        , it's not worth the effort., maybe try again later.<br><br> Finally, the till
        system boots up and makes the ca-ching noise that tills make. But then
        you hear it again - the noise - it seems to be coming from the 
        doorway. You think to yourself "it could be something in that box or 
        I could be imagining it, maybe it has something to do with the radio"
        . So many thoughts, the noise seems too significant to ignore. Or 
        maybe it will just go away.<br><br> You could go and investigate the noise or
        you could ignore it and get on with your day. Choose.
