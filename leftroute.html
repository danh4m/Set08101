    <p>You run down the route on the left as quick as you can. It is still 
        dangerously dark and you trip as you try to get away. The demon is 
        hot on your heels and seems to be catching up with you. You just 
        hope that you've picked the right path... <br><br>But unfortunately you 
        haven't... The alley comes to a dead end with brick walls of large 
        buildings towering on all three sides. You anxiously look around to 
        see if theres any windows or doors you could go through. Desperately 
        you try to find something you could use as a weapon but it't no good. 
        In your panicked fluster you weren't keeping an eye on the fast 
        approaching demon. The evil demon attacks and violently claws at your
        head. It's screech is piercingly loud.<br><br> Painfully, everything fades 
        into darkness. It's unlucky that you ridnt pick the <strong>right
        </strong> path. You are dead.
