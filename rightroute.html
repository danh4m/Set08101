    <p>You run down the route on the right as quick as you can. It is still 
        dangerously dark and you trip as you try to get away. The demon is 
        hot on your heels and seems to be catching up with you. You just 
        hope that you've picked the right path... <br><br> It seems as though
         you have! The alleyway leads to an open door to a stairwell. You get
        inside with enough time to barricade the doors behind you. <strong>
        hew</strong>. You hear the noise of the demon outside clawing at the 
        door trying to get in. But it can't. For now you are safe. You follow
        the stairwell up to the very top where it leads out onto a large roof 
        looking over the town. On the roof there is a small helicopter - an 
        escape! You don't know how to fly a helicopter but you see no other 
        choice. You get into the helicopter and stare at the instructions. 
        <br><br>Without thinking about it you begin to take off and are flying through 
        the air. You fly away, far away, as far away from that wretched town 
        as possible.
