    <p>You choose to carefully drag the velvet cloth out of the box. Wise choice as you don't know what is underneath. As you drag the cloth away it slowly reveals a vintage polaroid camera with the lens facing toward you. It looks in good condition too. You ask yourself 'Why did someone donate this?' People generously donate to the old mans shop mostly out of sympathy but it's only occasionally anything valuable like this. This camera must be pre 1990s and looks in great condition too. You take the box inside, place it on the counter and gently take the camera out of the box and inspect it. You lift it up for better lighting and think to yourself 'it looks brand new'. As you are lowering the camera you glimpse yourself in the mirror on the shelf behind the counter you stop and think about taking a photo of yourself in the mirror with the old camera...
