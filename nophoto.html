    <p> You chose not to take a photo of yourself.  You hear the jingle of the shop bell. In walks your friend. 
        Without taking a second to think you shout "Smile!" and snap a photo of them with the newly found camera. You quickly catch up with each other waiting for the polaorid to print out. You sense a dark aura in the room... The polareoid prints out into your hand and your friend leans in to see. Then you see it. Looming over your friends shoulder is a tall evil demon reaching out with evil intent. you look up from the polaroid... the demon screeches and launches itself toward the pair of you. It swings its claws trying to draw blood. you manage to wriggle free but it has now pinned your friend down and is about to tear their face off. You could run for your life and get out of there or you could try to help your friend. Choose.
