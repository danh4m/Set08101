        You chose to head to the nearby bus station. Running quickly you see a
        bus just about to leave the station. <strong>PHEW</strong>. You just 
        made it. Feeling safe but confused you take a window seat and slouch 
        into it. The driving begins heading toward your home. You look out the
        window onto the streets to see demons, zombies and ghouls wandering 
        amongst everyone else. No normal persons seem to be taking any notice
        of them at all. <br><br>The bus pulls onto your street and you can see your 
        house. Your home is surrounded by zombies, they seem disturbed and 
        angry. One zombie takes notice of your staring and begins sprinting 
        toward the bus. It doesn't seem like you'll be able to go home. The 
        bus drives off and you watch as the zombie continues it's pursuit. 
        What now? You ask yourself. Your friends house is on the same bus 
        route or you could head into town.
