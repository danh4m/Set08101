    <h1><br>Adventure</h1>
    <p>You are a <strong>student</strong> with a part time job in an old 
        antique shop. You work just enough to cover your rent and are always 
        balancing your time between studying and working. Your job includes 
        dusting, organizing shelves and helping customers - on the rare 
        occasion where they do come in. The shop is owned by a kind elderly 
        man called Mr Jones, he pays you just above minimum wage and lives 
        above the shop. You have been entrusted as a keyholder and see Mr 
        Jones very rarely.  Your adventure will start on what seems like an 
        average day for you...
