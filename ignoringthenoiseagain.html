    <p>You chose to ignore the ominous and unusual noise. But it continued to 
        sound. The noise gets progressively louder and louder until you can no
        longer bear it. It feels like your head is caving in and there is an 
        insurmountable amount of pressure on your ears. Blood starts dripping
        out of your ears and you feel your body getting weaker. Suddenly your
        legs give way and you are on the splintered old floorboards of the 
        shops.<br><br><strong> On your hands and knees you look up to the light coming in 
        through the window, it slowly fades into oblivion. You are dead. 
        Better luck next time.</strong>
