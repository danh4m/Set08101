    <h1>A regular day...<br></h1>
    <p>
        The harsh shrill of your alarm startles you awake. Out of bed you get.
        Into the shower. No uni today but just a shift in the antique shop 
        09:00-13:00 You start off what seems like a regular day with your 
        usual breakfast of a bowl of muesli and fruit. You walk to the 
        antique shop and when you arrive there is a dusty old box on the 
        doorstep. similair to a charity shop people in this town seem to 
        leave donations for some reason. this is nothing out of the ordinary
        and you grab your keys from your jacket pocket and enter the shop. 
        The dusty old bell attached to the door jingles as you enter the 
        shop, you cough as the dust particles invade your nostrils. Isn't it 
        strange how quickly dust gathers in this little shop. Once you are 
        settled and have put your jacket and bag in the back room you start up
        the til system, naturally it is an old system that takes ages to boot
        up. You begin to hear a strange, eerie noise coming from somewhere. 
        Do you investigate this noise or ignore it and continue setting up for
        the day?
