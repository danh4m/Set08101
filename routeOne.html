    <p>You think nothing of this noise - it could be the wind outside or an 
        old pipe somewhere. You go to turn the dusty old radio on behind the 
        till, holding your breath to prevent any inhalation of dust you reach 
        up and try to configure it to a radio station. You can't find any. 
        Each station plays out a horribly irritating static noise. You give up
        , it's not worth the effort., maybe try again later. Finally, the till
        system boots up and makes the ca-ching noise that tills make.
