        Well done... You were able to beat the scores of the arcade, the man 
        lets you into the the building and you head toward the stairwell. You
         are sweating, looking back you can see demons outside trying to get 
         in. Once entering the stairwell he leads you up the stairs onto  into
        the keypad it gave you access to a stairwell leading to the roof of the
        building. on top of the roof there was a helicopter.<br><br><strong>You jump 
        in the helicopter without thinking about it and fly as far away as 
        possible. Well done. You survived.</strong>
