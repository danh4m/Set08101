    <p>You chose to head to your friends house - seeing as yours was swamped 
        with monsters. You get off the bus and run up to their door, within 
        three knocks they have already answered and let you inside. They seem
        calm and invite you onto the sofa in their front room. You peer 
        through their blinds checking for monsters. The coast seems clear. 
        Your friend is chatting about the video game they just bought. You nod
        and smile but you're not listening. Your head is full of thoughts, 
        swarming your brain ruining your concentration. What is going on 
        today? Ever since you took that photo on that old camera the world 
        seems to have been turned upside down.<br><br>You feel a nudge on your arm 
        and jump with fear. "Hey are you alright? What's up?" your friend asks...        
    </p>
