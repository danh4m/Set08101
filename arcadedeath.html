    <p> You were unable to beat the arcade. You plead with the man to just let
        you in. You try explaining everything to him but he's having none of 
        it. You beg and you beg but he won't let you in. Nothing you say to 
        him has any impact on his decision. There's nothing you can do. The man
        goes to bolt the door shut. Out of sheer desperation you attempt to 
        barge past him but it's no use. He turns and looks at you with a frown
        .<strong>THWACK</strong>.<br><br> The man hits you with a right hook and you 
        fall to the floor in a heap. Barely conscious with your head on the 
        concrete ground you look up to see the dark demon figures surrounding 
        you. The demons harmonise their death chant and begin disemboweling you.
        Blood gushes everywhere.<br><br><strong>If only you'd been a wee bit better at video games.</strong>
